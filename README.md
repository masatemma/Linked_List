# Linked_List

Create a simple dictionary based on a linked list to store information from a dataset about the City of Melbourne. 
A user will be able to search this dictionary to retrieve information about footpaths in Melbourne using attributes in the dataset (keys).
The implementation of the dictionary is built by reading the data from a file and inserting each footpath record as a node in a linked list. 
A method to search for a key in the list is also implemented, outputting any records that match the key.
